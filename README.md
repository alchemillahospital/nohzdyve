# Goals
* Remake the *Nohzdyve* game featured in the Netflix film *Bandersnatch* using Unity and making all images and sounds from scratch, but based on the real game. 
* Add additional levels and characters, but keeping the style of the game and using the actual ZX Spectrum palette only

## What's done so far?
* 90% of images finished
* 90% of animations finished and added
* Teeth kill the player and move back and forth
* Eyeballs are worth 10 points and move back and forth
* Loading and title screens are mostly there

## What still needs done?
* I need to change some animations
* Title and loading screens need changed and tweaked a bit
* I haven't made the potted plants that are on the windowsills yet
* I could probably make more clotheslines with different clothes for variety
* I haven't added all colors of teeth and eyes yet
* Explosion animations need work and aren't implemented everywhere yet
* Sounds need redone and more sounds need to be added
* Need to tweak the location of the score and life icons at the top a bit

## What did I change from the original?
* AFAIK the little dude just falls forever until you lose (please correct me if I'm wrong), I have added three additional levels and made it so you beat the level by hitting the ground. 
* Added three additional characters so there are four in total
* I added grey brick to the ground
* Added win/lose screens
* Added info that it's a fan project to the title screen
* Camera pans right and left a bit rather than being fixed on the x-axis
* It doesn't push you out the window, you start off standing on the windowsill and are able to walk off of it
* Each level is progressively more difficult because I changed the gravity of the character, so the player falls faster in each level. First level is rather slow and easy.

## Info
This is a fan remake of a free game that you can find on one of the versions of the official *Bandersnatch* website (you can find all the info you need by Googling). I am remaking it just for some practice coding and because I loved Bandersnatch. All copyright for the game belongs to the original developers, no infringement intended.
